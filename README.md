## Installing SPIN
Installation instructions can be found here [https://spinroot.com/spin/Man/README.html](https://spinroot.com/spin/Man/README.html). These instructions suggest that you download binaries, so make sure you get the right one for your operating system. I don't see any binaries made for Apple Silicon.

If you prefer, you could clone the [official Github repo](https://github.com/nimble-code/Spin) and build from source. This looks something like `make; sudo cp Src/spin /usr/local/bin`, depending on your OS.

To check that your installation is working you can run `spin -V`.
